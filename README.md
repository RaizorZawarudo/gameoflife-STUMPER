# gameoflife-STUMPER
The game is played on a two-dimensional grid, with certain squares occupied by cells.
With each step, the cells’ evolution is entirely determined by the state of the eight neighboring squares,in the following way:
•In an empty square, a cell is born if it has exactly three neighboring cells.
•A cell that has zero or one neighbor dies from isolation.
•A cell that has four to eight neighbors dies from suffocation (lack of resource).
program will take 2 arguments: the path to a file containing the initial map and a numbern(n>=0) in-dicating the number of iterations to be done on the map.
Program will display the resulting grid after n iterations. Cells are represented using'X', empty squaresare represented using'.'. Timed
